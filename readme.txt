Speed up your site by replacing embedded Youtube videos with a clickable preview image. Visitors simply click on the image to play the video.

== Description ==

This plugin improves page load times and increases your Google PageSpeed Score. It replaces embedded Youtube videos with a clickable preview image.
By loading the videos only when the user clicks on the preview image – using jQuery –, no unnecessary JavaScript is loaded. Especially on sites with many embedded videos this will make your visitors happy.

Future features:
* Choose between several "Play" buttons
* Upload your own "Play" button
* Choose between several colours for your player
* (Optional) video preview image for feeds
* Support for videos from vimeo.com (and other providers)
* What you suggest


== Installation ==

Easily upload Lazy Load for Videos into you plugin directory (/wp-content/plugins/) and activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

You may have to clean the website's and browser's cache.

If you don't see a preview image instead of the Youtube video, open the article editor and update/save the article again. This should help.

= Does the Lazy Load for Videos plugin work when there is more than one video on the same page? =

= Should I use the Lazy Load for Videos plugin? =
The very short answer: Yes!

= Why? =
* If you want to speed your site up, this plugin is for you. Especially on sites with many embedded videos this plugin is helpful. There are multiple reasons why you should make your site faster, see next question.
* The plugin is really lightweight and does neither blow your performance nor your database up.
* By loading the videos only when the user clicks on the preview image, no unnecessary JavaScript is loaded. You may know this issue: (Defer) Parsing of JavaScript. "In order to load a page, the browser must parse the contents of all <script> tags, which adds additional time to the page load. By minimizing the amount of JavaScript needed to render the page, and deferring parsing of unneeded JavaScript until it needs to be executed, you can reduce the initial load time of your page." (Source: https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/best-practices/mobile#DeferParsingJS)
* Video preview and play button are scalable and optimized for mobile devices.
* Finally, Lazy Load for Videos is really easy to use. Simply upload and activate the plugin.

= Why are a faster website and a higher Google PageSpeed Score great? =
* Search engines, especially Google, love speedy sites! So you will be higher ranked in search results.
* Consequently, you get more visitors.
* Fast sites lead to higher visitor engagement and returning visitors.
* Moreover, faster sites increase conversations.

= How can I calculate my Google PageSpeed Score? =
PageSpeed Insights is a service by Google to help you optimize your site's performance. You can analyse your site using a browser extension or online, more information: https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/

= How to embed videos in WordPress? =
Easily post the URL to your content (e.g. Youtube video) into a post or page. The URL must be on its own line and must not be hyperlinked. "WordPress will automatically turn [the URL] into a YouTube embed when the post is viewed." (Source: http://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds)

= Solved: The plugin isn't working with Jetpack... =
"Jetpack" by WordPress.com offers some useful extensions. Only one of them makes Lazy Load for Videos break – the "Shortcode Embeds" extension. So simply disable the extension. (In order to see a "Deactivate" button for "Shortcode Embeds" on the Jetpack's extension overview, you must click on "Learn More".)

= Known bugs - this plugin may not work correctly when one of the following plugins is activated... =
* "YouTube" (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/youtube-embed-plus/)
* "Shortcode Embeds" extension within Jetpack, see answer above (http://jetpack.me/support/shortcode-embeds/)
* [???]
