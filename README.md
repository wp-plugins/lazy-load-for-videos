Lazy Load for Videos by [Kevin Weber](http://kevinw.de)
====================

This plugin improves page load times and increases your Google PageSpeed Score. It replaces embedded Youtube and Vimeo videos with a clickable preview image.
By loading the videos only when the user clicks on the preview image – using jQuery –, no unnecessary JavaScript is loaded. Especially on sites with many embedded videos this will make your visitors happy.
